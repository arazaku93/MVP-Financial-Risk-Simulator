MVP Financial Risk Simulator

Project Overview

This tool provides a transparent, data-driven assessment of the financial risks associated with launching a new Minimal Viable Product (MVP) or service flow. It translates technical and market uncertainties (like customer drop-off, competitive friction, and technical bottlenecks) into clear, projected financial metrics, including Revenue, Profit, and Lost Sales over a 12-month period.

This simulation uses a Monte Carlo approach to provide averaged monthly projections, accounting for real-world volatility.

Key Features

Financial Inputs: Define Unit Price, Cost per Unit, and fixed Operational Costs.

Operational Flow Definition: Define the critical steps in the user's journey. Each step is a point of potential friction/failure.

Risk Modeling: Apply adjustable stressors for:

Market Demand Volatility (e.g., High Demand stress on scale, or Low Demand financial stress).

Customer Conversion Friction (simulating competitive pressure or high friction in the sign-up).

Operational Bottleneck Multiplier (simulating technical instability causing step failures).

12-Month Projection: Generates a full P&L forecast under the defined stress scenario.

Lost Sales Quantification: Quantifies the precise revenue lost due to system friction and drop-off risks.
